The gnu-generate library allows you to write code that writes code that's free software. Now that's metaprogramming! If we constantly run gnu-generate on existing free software, eventually all uncreated software will be free.

Join us now and share the software. You'll be free hackers. You'll be free.

TODO
- Use GPL'd code for example instead of some code from an exploitation blog post.
- Add support for uploading to github.
